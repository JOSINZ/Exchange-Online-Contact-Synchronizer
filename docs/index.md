## Description
The **Exchange Online Contact Synchronizer** (EOCS) is a service for synchronizing contacts from a web API into your own Microsoft Outlook contacts.
The following features are planned:

- Authentication with the Microsoft Identity Platform 
- Continuous synchronization of contacts from one data source (Web API) 
- Provision of multiple data sources
- Personal setup of the synchronization by the user
- Web UI for configuring and setting up personal synchronization
- Admin panel for configuration of the service

> One possible application scenario is the synchronization of customers or vendors from Dynmaics 365 Business Central into your own Outlook contacts. For example, the customer name can be displayed when a Microsoft Teams call is received from the customer.
